# Naming survey: unnamed labels and proposed names

Research notes for renaming unnamed labels in this disassembly. Nothing in the
code has been changed; every entry below is a proposal for a human to accept
or reject.

## Progress

- [x] Inventory and plan (this section and the two below)
- [x] Phase 1: WRAM / SRAM / HRAM unnamed variables (all 88 address-named labels; `wUnused_*` left as is)
- [ ] Phase 2: home bank (`src/home/`) `Func_` routines, incl. the bank $18 targets of the `homejp` trampolines in `src/home/object_mechanics.asm`
- [ ] Phase 3: fork focus areas (camera/floor transitions, room loading, save code, debug menu, owl / object interactions)
- [ ] Phase 4: rest of the level engine (`src/engine/level/*.asm`, block functions)
- [ ] Phase 5: `unk` fields in structs and constants
- [ ] Phase 6: object-local `.Func_` states in `src/engine/level/objects/`
- [ ] Phase 7+: overworld, action help, data/framesets/OAM/palettes, audio

**Resume at:** Phase 2 (home bank `Func_`).

## Inventory (master at f205aa3)

Counts are label *definitions* found by a scan of `src/**/*.asm|inc` for
`Prefix_<4-6 hex digits>` and address-named RAM (`wXXXX`, `w3dXXX`, `s0aXXX`,
`hffXX`). Scanner: a throwaway Python script, not committed.

## Plan

Order is by value: how many places a name would clarify, and how close the
code is to what this fork works on.

1. **RAM variables (WRAM/SRAM/HRAM, ~88).** Small, high leverage: every
   routine that touches them reads better. Done by grepping all accesses.
2. **Home bank `Func_` (62) and their far targets.** Home routines are called
   from everywhere. Most of `src/home/object_mechanics.asm` is `homejp`
   trampolines (`Func_3191:: homejp Func_62e8f`) to bank $18 in
   `src/engine/level/update_objects.asm`; each pair is named together
   (`Foo::` in home, `_Foo::` in bank $18, as the existing `ObjState_Fall` /
   `_ObjState_Fall` pair does).
3. **Fork focus areas:** `src/engine/level/camera.asm`,
   `src/home/floor_transition.asm`, room loading (`src/home/load_room.asm`,
   `src/engine/level/start_room.asm`, door/room transitions), save code
   (`src/engine/pause/save/`), debug menu, owl / object interactions
   (`src/engine/level/object_interactions.asm`, `update_objects.asm`,
   `collisions.asm`).
4. **Rest of the level engine:** `wario_states_1..4.asm`, `block_functions.asm`
   (117 `Func_` + 58 `BlockFunc_`), `scroll.asm`, `block_queue.asm`.
5. **`unk` struct fields and constants** (`OBJ_UNK_*`, `OBJSUBFLAG_UNK_4`,
   `COLLISION_UNK*`), once the code that uses them has been read.
6. **Object-local `.Func_` states** (835 in level/objects): named per object
   as `.Walk`, `.Turn`, etc., where the state is clear.
7. **Lower priority:** overworld banks (596 `Func_`, 1224 `.Func_`; mostly
   cutscene/scene scripting), action help demos (306 `Func_`, scripted
   input for the power-up help screens), audio engine, `Data_`/`Pals_`/
   `Frameset_`/`OAM_` (named in bulk from the object or scene that uses them).
   `.asm_` locals only where they clarify a routine already analysed.

## Conventions used for proposals

- Routines: `VerbNoun` in PascalCase (`HandleUpwardsFloorTransition`,
  `SetState_OwlWario`, `UpdateState_BatFlying`); home/far pairs as `Foo` /
  `_Foo`; object states as `ObjState_*`.
- WRAM: `w` + PascalCase noun (`wFloorTransitionTimer`); SRAM `s...`; HRAM `h...`.
- Locals: `.snake_case` (`.got_obj`, `.loop`, `.done`).
- Every proposed name was grepped against `src/` to check it is unused.
- Confidence: **high** = behaviour fully read and the name follows directly;
  **medium** = role clear but details or intent partly inferred;
  **low** = educated guess.

## Findings

### Phase 1: RAM variables

Table columns: current label, definition, proposed name, evidence, confidence.
"Write-only" means every reference in `src/` stores to it and none reads it.

#### WRAM0: level engine

| Current | Where | Proposed | Evidence | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wc08a` | src/ram/wram.asm:26 | `wHiddenFigureBaseSCY` | Set from `wCameraSCY+1` at room start (start_room.asm:427) together with `wHiddenFigureSCYShake`; in the Hidden Figure camera config it replaces `wSCY` when computing `wWarioScreenYPos` (camera.asm:355), and hidden_figure.asm `.Func_4d655` resets `wSCY` to it (+`wSCYShake`). The fixed camera Y of the Hidden Figure room. | medium |
| `wc08b` | src/ram/wram.asm:27 | `wHiddenFigureSCX` | Written to `wSCX` instead of the camera's when `wCameraConfigFlags == HIDDEN_FIGURE_CAMCONFIG` (update_level.asm:36, update_objects.asm:46); hidden_figure.asm `Func_4cf87` adds table deltas to it exactly as `Func_4cf70` does to `wHiddenFigureSCYShake`. X counterpart of `wHiddenFigureSCYShake` (which could itself become `wHiddenFigureSCY`). | high |
| `wc08c` | src/ram/wram.asm:28 | `wHiddenFigureBaseSCX` | X counterpart of `wc08a`: copied from `wCameraSCX+1` at room start, used for `wWarioScreenXPos` in the Hidden Figure camera config and to restore `wSCX`. | medium |
| `wc08d` | src/ram/wram.asm:29 | `wHiddenFigureWY` | Initialised to $88 and written to `rWY` in init.asm:54; each frame of the fight `rWY = wc08d + wSCYShake` (update_level.asm:38). The window Y used by the Hidden Figure fight. | high |
| `wc0b3` | src/ram/wram.asm:102 | `wBGMapTileVRAM1QueuePtr` | Big-endian pointer set to `wBGMapTileVRAM1Queue + wBGMapTileQueueSize` and advanced while queueing block attributes in scroll.asm (`.Func_9605`, `.Func_9d4c`, `Func_a79e`, `Func_b182`). VRAM1 twin of `wcce7`. | high |
| `wc0c4` | src/ram/wram.asm:157 | `wRoomObjMapLowerY` | load_room.asm:150: `wRoomLowerYLimit * 16 + $a0` ($ff if it wraps), i.e. the room's lower limit as an SRAM page of `sLevelBlockObjectMap`. start_room.asm `.Func_89e2` spawns an object from the map only if its row is in [`wc0c5`, `wc0c4`). | high |
| `wc0c5` | src/ram/wram.asm:160 | `wRoomObjMapUpperY` | Same, from `wRoomUpperYLimit`. | high |
| `wc0c6` | src/ram/wram.asm:163 | `wRoomObjMapLeftX` | `wRoomLeftXLimit * 8 + $b0`: the room's left limit as a byte offset into the object half of a map row ($b0-$ff, two objects per byte). Compared with `l` in `.Func_89e2`. | high |
| `wc0c7` | src/ram/wram.asm:166 | `wRoomObjMapRightX` | Same, from `wRoomRightXLimit` ($ff on wrap). | high |
| `wc0d0` | src/ram/wram.asm:179 | `wRoomTileMapBank` | load_room_gfx.asm:42 copies `wRoomBlockFunctionTableBank` into it right before `LoadRoomTileMap`, which decompresses `RoomBlockAttributePointers[wRoomTileMap]` from that bank (load_room.asm:220). Sits in the per-room bank list between `wRoomBlockFunctionTableBank` and `wRoomMainTilesBank`. | high |
| `wc0d4` | src/ram/wram.asm:186 | `wCameraYIdleCounter` | camera.asm `LevelScroll_Vertical`: reset to 0 on frames with a `wCameraYDelta`; incremented on frames without one, and the camera re-centres on Wario only from the second such frame (`ret z ; return if wc0d4 == 1`). | medium |
| `wc0d5` | src/ram/wram.asm:189 | `wCameraXIdleCounter` | Same for `LevelScroll_Horizontal` / `wCameraXDelta`. | medium |
| `wc0dc` | src/ram/wram.asm:222 | `wFrontCollisionBlockY` | collisions.asm: `CheckBottomRight/LeftCollision` store `hYPosLo & $f0` (block row of the probed point); `Func_19832` compares it with the row of Wario's collision-box top to decide whether there is a second block above to probe. | medium |
| `wc0e0` | src/ram/wram.asm:233 | `wUnused_c0e0` | Write-only: only zeroed in Wario state setters (wario_states_1.asm:1508, 1565, 1694, 2064; wario_states_2.asm:558). | high |
| `wc0e1` | src/ram/wram.asm:236 | `wWaterCurrentBlockedDir` | Holds a `PAD_*` direction: set by swim-move routines around wario_states_1.asm:5525-5683 and 2163, cleared at the start of every swimming `UpdateState_*`; the water-current handlers (wario_states_1.asm:3940-4147) don't push Wario in a direction whose bit is set. The exact condition the swim code sets it on wasn't traced. | medium |
| `wc18e` | src/ram/wram.asm:305 | `wBlockRedrawQueue` | Ring buffer of 8 big-endian block pointers (bank folded into the high byte, `h + (wBlockPtrBank-1)*$20`). `Func_e31` (home/sprite.asm:160) appends `wBlockPtr`; `Func_bb85` (block_queue.asm:173) takes one entry per frame when no DMA is pending, queues its 2x2 tiles and attributes for VBlank and clears the entry. | high |
| `wc19e` | src/ram/wram.asm:306 | `wBlockRedrawQueueWriteIndex` | Byte offset into `wc18e` where `Func_e31` writes; `+2 & $0f`. | high |
| `wc19f` | src/ram/wram.asm:307 | `wBlockRedrawQueueReadIndex` | Byte offset into `wc18e` that `Func_bb85` reads; `+2 & $0f`. | high |
| `wc1c1` | src/ram/wram.asm:365 | `wObjOverlapFromAbove` | `ProcessInteractions` (object_interactions.asm:78-165): `(Wario bottom) - (obj top)`, kept only when it is the smaller of the two vertical overlaps ($ff otherwise). Picks `INTERACTION_UP/DOWN`; object_interactions.asm:1249 uses it to land on a steppable object. | high |
| `wc1c2` | src/ram/wram.asm:366 | `wObjOverlapFromBelow` | `(obj bottom) - (Wario top)`, same rules. | high |
| `wc1c3` | src/ram/wram.asm:367 | `wObjOverlapFromLeft` | `(Wario right) - (obj left)`; object_interactions.asm:1325 and 2108 push Wario out with `MoveWarioLeft` by this amount. | high |
| `wc1c4` | src/ram/wram.asm:368 | `wObjOverlapFromRight` | `(obj right) - (Wario left)`; used with `MoveWarioRight`. | high |
| `wc1ca` | src/ram/wram.asm:384 | `wHitFloorBlock` | Set TRUE by `BlockFunc_Floor` and `BlockFunc_18262` (one-way floors), cleared before probes in collisions.asm `Func_19a77` and several object collision routines in update_objects.asm (1105, 1312, 2002, ...), which then treat "solid, but a floor block" differently. | medium |
| `wca65` | src/ram/wram.asm:521 | `wWarioSpriteFrame` | `UpdateAnimation` (home/sprite.asm:211) stores the next frame number from Wario's frameset here (`wAnimationFrame` is the offset into the frameset); `DrawWario` copies it to `wCurSpriteFrame`. | high |
| `wca66` | src/ram/wram.asm:524 | `wWarioSpriteAttributes` | Copied to `wCurSpriteAttributes` when drawing Wario (home/sprite.asm:39); only ever cleared (start_room.asm:309). | medium |
| `wca6c` | src/ram/wram.asm:549 | `wUnused_ca6c` (or `wTransitionRoomCoords`) | Write-only: start_room.asm:52 stores `(wWarioYPos hi << 4) \| wWarioXPos hi` (Wario's room-grid cell) on a room transition; start_room.asm:293 clears it. | high |
| `wca94` | src/ram/wram.asm:691 | `wSpikeTouchState` | Read only by `BlockFunc_NonSolidSpike/SolidSpike`: 0 = `SetState_Stung`, 1 = `Func_206eb` (end the transformation, then sting), 2 = spikes are harmless. Set by every transformation setter (2 for Hot/Fat/Bouncy/Zombie..., 1 for Ball o' String/Puffy/...), cleared by `ClearTransformationValues`. Pairs with `wTouchState`/`wStingTouchState`; values could get `SPIKE_TOUCH_*` constants. | high |
| `wcaa1` | src/ram/wram.asm:741 | `wSavedEnemyPals` | 4 palettes. `SaveLevel` copies OB palettes 4-7 of the backup palettes (`w3d280 palette 12`) here before saving Level WRAM; on continuing, start_room.asm:382 copies them back into `wTempPals2 palette 4`. | high |
| `wcce7` | src/ram/wram.asm:793 | `wBGMapTileVRAM0QueuePtr` | Set to `wBGMapTileVRAM0Queue + wBGMapTileQueueSize` (comment at scroll.asm:321) and advanced while queueing block tiles in row_block_queue.asm and scroll.asm. | high |
| `wccec` | src/ram/wram.asm:801 | `wObjectMapBank` | SRAM bank of the object-map entry being processed: set from `wBlockPtrBank` by `Func_d8c`, from the row's bank in start_room.asm:506/541, read by `Func_cf8` for the Y position and to `sramswitch` back in block_queue.asm. | medium |

#### WRAM0: save, VBlank and misc

| Current | Where | Proposed | Evidence | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `wcedb` | src/ram/wram.asm:889 | `wMultiBlockOriginBank` | Block functions that start a multi-block break (`Func_18f32`, `Func_19086`, `Func_19246`, `Func_193dc` in block_functions.asm) store `wSRAMBank` here, the block pointer in `wcedc` and its value in `wcedf`; `ProcessMultiBlock.ProcessBlocks` (start_room.asm:184-256) walks to the neighbour above/below/left/right of that origin. | medium |
| `wcedc` | src/ram/wram.asm:890 | `wMultiBlockOriginPtr` | See above (big-endian block pointer). | medium |
| `wcede` | src/ram/wram.asm:891 | `wUnused_cede` | Write-only (start_room.asm:182: bit 3 of `wMultiBlockParam`). | high |
| `wcedf` | src/ram/wram.asm:892 | `wUnused_cedf` (or `wMultiBlockOriginBlock`) | Write-only: the origin block's value, stored by the four routines above and never read. | high |
| `wcee4` | src/ram/wram.asm:904 | `wBGUpdateRequest` | Shared by several screens' VBlank functions: bit 7 asks VBlank to draw something once and VBlank clears it (pause/save/vblank.asm:26, title/vblank.asm:13, clear/vblank.asm, language_selection/vblank.asm, credits.asm); the low bits are a per-screen parameter (save-bar tile count in `FillSaveScreenBar`, start-menu box choice $80/$81). | medium |
| `wcee9` | src/ram/wram.asm:911 | `wChecksumAlt1` | `ValidateSaveData.GetMatchingChecksum` stores the best of three stored checksums in `wChecksum` and the other two here and in `wceeb`; callers retry the computed checksum against them when `wChecksumMismatches` is non-zero. | high |
| `wceeb` | src/ram/wram.asm:912 | `wChecksumAlt2` | See above. | high |
| `wceee` | src/ram/wram.asm:921 | `wValidSaves` | Bit flags set by `Func_1f0d60`: bit 0 game data, 1 backup game data, 2 level save (`sWRAMChecksum`), 3/4/5 level backups 1/2/3, 6 level map, 7 backup level map. `Func_1f1246` uses `& $3f`. `VALID_SAVE_*_F` constants would help. | high |
| `wceef` | src/ram/wram.asm:922 | `wRestoredSave` | `Func_1f1246` narrows it from the valid saves to the one with the highest save counter and restores that; `StartRoom_FromLevelStart` tests `and %00111100` ("if from saved level, don't init start level vars"); level init clears it. | medium |
| `wcef1` | src/ram/wram.asm:932 | `wSaveProgress` | `ValidateSaveData` stores the value the three copies `s0a790/s0a7e0/s0afa0` agree on ($ff if none agree). Write-only in practice. | medium |
| `w3d280` | src/ram/wram.asm:2435 | `wBackupPals` | `SaveBackupVRAM` copies `wTempPals1` (16 palettes) here along with the VRAM backup; `LoadBackupVRAM` restores them; `SaveLevel` takes the enemy palettes from it. | high |
| `w3d500` | src/ram/wram.asm:2441 | `wBackupSCY` | Saved/restored with `wSCY` by `SaveBackupVRAM`/`LoadBackupVRAM`. overworld/init.asm:632 also decompresses data into it (that area is reused there). | high |
| `w3d501` | src/ram/wram.asm:2444 | `wBackupSCX` | Same for `wSCX`. | high |
| `w3d50d` | src/ram/wram.asm:2480 | `wUnused_3d50d` | Write-only (title/start_menu.asm:181, action_help/core.asm:247). | high |
| `w3d511` | src/ram/wram.asm:2494 | `wTempTimeAttackScore` | pause/bank7d.asm:74 and clear/bank78.asm:74 copy a level's 2-byte BCD entry of `wLevelTimeAttackScores` here and print its four digits from it. | high |
| `wdc11` | src/ram/wram.asm:1238 | `wGolfHDMADest` | Union alias of `wGolfWarioTilesPtr`. `Func_2c30`'s header (home/load_golf_sprite.asm) says "wdc11 = destination"; written to `rVDMA_DEST_HIGH/LOW`. Set by golf/hole.asm `VBlank_1c9ffa`/`VBlank_1ca056`. | high |
| `w1dc13` | src/ram/wram.asm:1241 | `wGolfHDMALength` | "w1dc13 = length - 1"; written to `rVDMA_LEN`. | high |
| `w2d150`, `w2d151`, `wd152`..`wd156` | src/ram/wram.asm:1972-1992 | (generic) `wOWSceneVar1`..`wOWSceneVar7` | Overworld scratch shared by unrelated cutscenes: a per-scene-object jumptable index in bank56.asm (`.Func_1586a1`...), a step counter in bank2b_2.asm `Func_ae523`, a data pointer (`w2d151`/`wd152`) in bank2d.asm `.Func_b7056`, delays in bank2d.asm `.Func_b59b6`. `wd152` is already aliased `wDebugSceneWarioState`. No single meaning; a neutral name is the honest option. | low |

#### Audio RAM and HRAM

| Current | Where | Proposed | Evidence | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `w3d008` | src/ram/wram.asm:2309 | `wSFXTempoAccumulator` | audio/engine.asm:94-138: `wSFXTempo` is added to this 16-bit value each frame; SFX channels advance one tick whenever it reaches $4a, which is then subtracted. | high |
| `w3d00d` | src/ram/wram.asm:2316 | `wMusicTempoAccumulator` | Same for `wMusicTempo` (audio/engine.asm:145-186). | high |
| `w3d01a` | src/ram/wram.asm:2349 | `wAudioFrameCycle` | Counts 14..0 and wraps (audio/engine.asm:197-203); `Func_30bfb` increments a track's frequency only when it is 0 (engine.asm:2257). What the effect is for is unclear. | low |
| `w3d025` | src/ram/wram.asm:2382 | `wMusicChannelsDeactivated` | $ff in `DeactivateMusicChannels`, 0 when music starts and in `Func_302e4`; `UpdateMusicFadeOut` returns while it's set ("music channels are deactivated"). | high |
| `hffa0` | src/ram/hram.asm:9 | `hTemp` | First byte of an HRAM union already aliased `hThrownObjInteractionType` / `hIsInWaterOrSandBackup`; used as a scratch byte by load_objects.asm (loop counter), coin.asm, update_objects.asm (a Y velocity: "; y vel") and musical_coin_flags.asm. | medium |
| `hffac` | src/ram/hram.asm:37 | `hAudioTempA` | home/audio.asm: holds `a` across `push_wram BANK("Audio RAM")` in every audio trampoline (`ExecuteAudioMod` and the unreferenced ones). | high |

#### SRAM (src/ram/sram.asm)

The save system keeps a game save plus a backup, and an in-level save ("WRAM"
save: Progress + Level WRAM, the treasure flags and the level objects) in four
copies. Every write is bracketed by a step marker stored three times
(`s0a790/s0a7e0/s0afa0`), each checksum is stored three times (`...Echo1/2`),
and the level's block/object map (SRAM1 + first half of SRAM2) has a backup
copy (SRAM3 + second half of SRAM2). The proposals extend the existing
`sWRAMChecksum`, `sBackup1..3WRAMChecksum`, `...Echo1/2` names. Note the four
level-save copies are written in the order a000, a800, a400, ac00, matching
`sWRAMChecksum`, `sBackup1/2/3WRAMChecksum`.

| Current | Where | Proposed | Evidence | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `s0a000` | sram.asm:3 | `sWRAMCheckVals` | `SaveLevel` writes `CHECKVAL2` ("WAR3") here, followed by the level save data (which starts at `sSaveCounter`), checksum in `sWRAMChecksum`; `ValidateSaveData` checks it with `CheckSaveVals2`; level init (init.asm:28) and home/clear_save.asm clear it. | high |
| (none) at $a004 | sram.asm:6 | add `sWRAMData::` | `sSaveCounter`/`sGeneralData`/`sLevelData` are fields of the level save that starts here; validate_save.asm:344 checksums from `sSaveCounter`. A label would mirror the backups below. | medium |
| `s0a400` | sram.asm:25 | `sBackup2WRAMCheckVals` | Third copy written by `SaveLevel`; checksum in `sBackup2WRAMChecksum`. | high |
| `s0a404` | sram.asm:28 | `sBackup2WRAMData` | The data after it, checksummed with `Func_1f0b5b` against `sBackup2WRAMChecksum` (validate_save.asm:545). | high |
| `s0a790` | sram.asm:33 | `sSaveProgress` | Step marker written before/after each part of a save ($10-$13 game data, $20-$23 backup game data, $30-$83 level save parts, 0 when done); `ValidateSaveData` compares the three copies. | high |
| `s0a79d` | sram.asm:44 | `sLevelMapChecksum` | Result of `CalculateBackupSRAMChecksum1` (SRAM1 + `s2a000`); bit 6 of `wceee`. | high |
| `s0a79f` | sram.asm:47 | `sBackupLevelMapChecksum` | Result of `CalculateBackupSRAMChecksum2` (SRAM3 + `s2b000`), written by `Func_1f14c6`; bit 7 of `wceee`. | high |
| `s0a7e0` | sram.asm:52 | `sSaveProgressEcho1` | Second copy of `s0a790`. | high |

| `s0a800` | sram.asm:71 | `sBackup1WRAMCheckVals` | Second copy written by `SaveLevel`; checksum in `sBackup1WRAMChecksum`. | high |
| `s0a804` | sram.asm:74 | `sBackup1WRAMData` | Checksummed against `sBackup1WRAMChecksum` (validate_save.asm:417). | high |
| `s0ac00` | sram.asm:87 | `sBackup3WRAMCheckVals` | Fourth copy; `sBackup3WRAMChecksum`. | high |
| `s0ac04` | sram.asm:90 | `sBackup3WRAMData` | Checksummed against `sBackup3WRAMChecksum`. | high |

| `s0afe0`..`s0aff4` | sram.asm:114-129 | `sSaveCounterCompare1`..`6` | `Func_1f1246` copies the first 4 bytes (save counter) of the 6 saves (game, backup game, level, level backups 1/2/3) here and shifts them left bit by bit to find the highest counter. | medium |
| `s0aff8` | sram.asm:132 | `sSaveCounterCompareBits` | Per-iteration mask of which of those saves shifted out a 1. | medium |
| `s2a000` | sram.asm:145 | `sLevelBlockObjectMap2` | Continuation of `sLevelBlockObjectMap` ($1000 bytes): switch.asm toggles switch blocks in it with the same loop as in SRAM1; part of `CalculateBackupSRAMChecksum1`. | high |
| `s2b000` | sram.asm:148 | `sBackupLevelBlockObjectMap2` | `Func_1f14c6` copies `s2a000` here; `Func_1f1246.Func_1f1420` copies it back. | high |
| `s3a000` | sram.asm:153 | `sBackupLevelBlockObjectMap` | Whole-bank copy of SRAM1 made by `Func_1f14c6` (which loads `hl` with `s0a000`, i.e. $a000, while SRAM1 is mapped: it means `sLevelBlockObjectMap`), copied back by `.Func_1f1420`. | high |

#### Struct fields and flags met along the way

| Current | Where | Proposed | Evidence | Conf. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `OBJ_UNK_01` / `OBJ_UNK_02` (+ `wCurObjUnk01/02`) | src/constants/object_constants.asm:238-239 | `OBJ_MAP_PTR_LO` / `OBJ_MAP_PTR_HI` (`wCurObjMapPtrLo/Hi`) | Pointer to the object's entry in the object map (SRAM bank folded into the high byte, as in `wBlockRedrawQueue`). `DespawnObject` (block_queue.asm:120) reads it to set bit 7 of the map entry; the fork's own comment there says objects spawned outside the map have no entry. update_objects.asm:3986 checks it before calling `DespawnObject`; debug_menu/spawn_object.asm:44 zeroes it. | high |
| `OBJ_UNK_1D` (+ `wCurObjUnk1d`) | object_constants.asm:262 | `OBJ_ACTION_SIDE` | `SetObjAction` (object_interactions.asm:807) stores `wInteractionSide` (the `INTERACTION_*` bits, upper nybble) here next to `OBJ_ACTION`; the action handlers in update_objects.asm (`.Bump`, `.Attack`, `.Wobble`) test `INTERACTION_RIGHT` in it to choose the knock-back direction; togeba.asm/haridama.asm test bit 7 (`INTERACTION_DOWN`). The low nybble is preserved but no use was seen. | high |
| `OBJSUBFLAG_UNK_4` | object_constants.asm:288 | `OBJSUBFLAG_NO_DESPAWN` | update_objects.asm:3976: an object far offscreen is despawned (`DespawnObject`) unless this bit is set. Set by bosses, chests, torches, Sun/Moon, Pesce, Muddee and others, and in object_params.asm substates. | high |
